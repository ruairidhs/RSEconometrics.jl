# RSEconometrics
Functions for econometric analysis in Julia.

This is a package containing econometrics-related functions that I use across projects.
It is designed for my own use and therefore not registered in the official Julia registry.
However, feel free to use the functions if they are useful to you (under the terms of `LICENSE.md`).
